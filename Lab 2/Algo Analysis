Assumptions for analysis

1) Make sure that the generated graph is connected -> There is a minimum path to any point. Eqn must hold, (|E| >= |V|-1)
2) Graph is undirected (|E| <= |V| * (|V|-1)) /2 

Therefore,  |V|-1 <= |E| <= |V| * (|V|-1) /2


// Using https://github.com/ifsmirnov/jngen to generate graph [Generating Algo ensure that graph is connected]
// Benchmark library https://github.com/dtrugman/Benchmark/tree/master


Testcase Set 1 

Goal: How algorithm time complexity changes wrt |V|, |E| should be a constant

From V=200 to V=1000. Keep |E| >= |V|-1 (To ensure that the graph is connected). 
|E| = 5000

For ADJ Matrix, (Expect it to increase at a rate of 2*V^2 -> O(V^2))

For ADJ List, (Expect it to increase at a rate of V + 10000Log V -> O(V))

Testcase Set 2

Goal: How algorithm time complexity changes wrt |E|.


Keep V constant (|V|=100), change E, |V|-1 <= |E| <= |V| * (|V|-1) /2

|E| from 99 to 4950

For ADJ Matrix, (Expect the time complexity to be constant)

For ADJ List, (Expect the time complexity to increase at a rate of E)

Task C: Compare implementations (My guess from time complexity analysis, )
https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc315/iii-graphs/7-graphs-list-representation/3-dense-vs-sparse/
I think the answer is sparse graph vs dense graph. Sub |E| = |V| * (|V|-1) / 2

O(|V|^2 log |V|) vs O(|V|^2) 

Dense graph -> ADJ Matrix Better

Sparse Graph -> ADJ List better
